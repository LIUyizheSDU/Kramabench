    "Keep only the fires whose start_date month is January, February, or March.",
    "Exclude rows whose cause is coded as 'U' (unknown) so only known-cause fires remain.",
    "Build a contingency table (cross-tabulation) counting the number of fires for every combination of region and cause.",
    "From the contingency table, obtain the chi-square statistic and the associated p-value."
