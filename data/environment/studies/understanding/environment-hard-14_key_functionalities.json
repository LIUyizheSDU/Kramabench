    "Read 2007-2009 water-quality-testing CSVs.",
    "Tell whether a beach is Marine or Fresh from 'Beach Type Description'.",
    "For each type, flag exceedances by selecting rows whose 'Violation' column (case-insensitive) equals 'yes'.",
    "Compute yearly exceedance rate for each type:  (# rows with violation) / (# rows of that beach type).",
    "For Marine rainfall: read the monthly_precipitations_*.csv files for Boston and Chatham; keep Year + summer-month (Jun, Jul, Aug) columns, keep only 2007\u20132009 rows, cast month columns to float, sum Jun+Jul+Aug per year to get a summer total, then average the two cities\u2019 totals year-wise.",
    "For Fresh rainfall: repeat the same procedure for Boston, Chatham, Amherst and Ashburnham, then average the four cities year-wise.",
    "Calculate the Pearson correlation between the 3-year exceedance-rate vector and the 3-year rainfall vector for Marine beaches and Fresh beaches respectively.",
    "Compare the correlation coefficients to determine which beach type shows the higher summer rainfall-exceedance correlation."
