    "Read each boston beach CSV file. Skip the first row and use the next two rows as a multi-level header.",
    "Handle the two-level column header: handle 'Unnamed' placeholders, handle empty cells in top-level header, then combine the two levels to get column names.",
    "Separate the columns that contain measurement data (those with 'Tag' or 'Enterococcus' in the name) from the identifier columns.",
    "Have separate 'Location' and 'Measure' fields, or handle the combined header during filtering for Location.",
    "Convert all non-identifier / non-text columns to numeric types, handling malformed data.",
    "Filter for rows where the '3-Day Rain' value equals 0 (no rainfall during the preceding three days).",
    "Mark exceedances by filtering for rows where the numeric 'Enterococcus' value is greater than 104 counts/100 mL.",
    "After the filters, count exceedance rows for each beach and get the beach with the largest count across all files."
