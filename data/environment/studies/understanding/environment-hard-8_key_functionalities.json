    "For every beach CSV in the Boston-Harbor datasheet: read while skipping the first row and using the next two rows as a multi-index header.",
    "Clean the two-level header by handling empty first-level cells, then combine the two levels so to get columnn names.",
    "Separate measurement columns (those containing 'Tag' or 'Enterococcus'); treat everything else as identifying columns (date, time, etc.).",
    "Have separate records for 'Location' and 'Measure' or handle this during filtering for Location.",
    "Cast all measurement columns to numeric.",
    "For each beach: filter rows where Enterococcus is greater than 104 to count total exceedances (fails).",
    "Filter for rows where 1-Day Rain is greater than 0 to count failures that had rainfall in the previous 24 hours.",
    "Accumulate counts across all beaches passing the filters and compute (rain-related exceedances \u00f7 total exceedances), possibly multiplying by 100 to get percentage value."
