    "Load the yearly\u2010mean sunspot CSV file using semicolon delimiter and assign explicit column names.",
    "Create an integer year column by flooring the potentially fractional Year values (e.g., 1960.5 \u279c 1960).",
    "Filter the data frame to retain only rows whose integer year falls between 1960 and 2020, inclusive.",
    "Extract the year and mean sunspot number arrays from the filtered data for analysis.",
    "Use scipy.signal.find_peaks on the sunspot series to locate maxima with a prominence \u226520 and a minimum separation of 5 years; record their indices, years, and values.",
    "Apply the same peak-finding procedure to the negated series to identify minima (troughs) under identical prominence and distance requirements.",
    "Compute the average solar\u2010cycle period by taking the mean difference between successive minima years if at least two minima exist.",
    "Report (print) the calculated average period along with the years and sunspot numbers of all detected maxima and minima, effectively highlighting the top solar activity highs and lows in 1960-2020."
