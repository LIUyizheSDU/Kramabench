    "For each candidate lag from 0 to 47 hours, shift the AP series forward by that lag so that an AP value at t is compared to a semi-major-axis change at t + lag, inner-join the two series, and compute their Pearson correlation r; square r to obtain r\u00b2.",
    "Track the lag that yields the maximum r\u00b2, skipping any lag where fewer than two overlapping points exist, and finally print the best lag together with its r\u00b2 value."
