    "Load the TLE text file for NORAD-ID 48445, strip blank lines, and split it into consecutive (line1, line2) pairs; raise an error if the number of lines is odd.",
    "Create a Skyfield TimeScale object (ts) that will be reused for epoch and coordinate calculations.",
    "For every TLE pair, build an EarthSatellite object, obtain the epoch-instant position with satellite.at(ts.utc(epoch)), convert the resulting GCRS position to ITRF XYZ metres via .itrf_xyz().m, and compute the satellite\u2019s geocentric distance; divide by 1000 to store altitude in kilometres.",
    "Record the calculated altitude and its corresponding epoch timestamp for each TLE snapshot in two aligned lists.",
    "Iterate over consecutive altitude measurements; for each pair compute the absolute altitude change (delta_a) and the elapsed time in hours (delta_t).",
    "Flag a \u2018major altitude change\u2019 event when delta_a exceeds the user-supplied threshold (threshold_km = 1 km, i.e. >1000 m) AND the two measurements are within 12 hours (t_hours = 12).  Store the epoch and magnitude for every event that meets both conditions.",
    "After scanning all TLE entries, report the maximum detected altitude change as well as the total count of flagged events, and list each event\u2019s epoch and delta_a.",
    "Provide basic error handling: catch file-read problems, TLE line-count mismatch, missing density columns, or other unexpected exceptions, and print informative messages."
